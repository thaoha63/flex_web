            Algorithmic bias, a pervasive issue in modern healthcare, refers to the presence of unfair discrimination in the outcomes produced by AI algorithms.

            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
              Technological innovations are the new norm in a rapidly evolving world. For example, the development of robotics and algorithms has become increasingly prevalent worldwide. While there are numerous benefits to using artificial intelligence (AI) in one’s daily life, significant problems involving bias in healthcare algorithms have also emerged. 
              <br> Stanford Professor John McCarthy defines artificial intelligence as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines” (Guardian, 2011).

            <h3>Issue</h3>
            <p>
               Many research studies have the scientists program their machines to behave in a clever way, through high-intelligence activities such as playing chess. However, today we accept and emphasize that machines can learn to a certain capacity, at least somewhat similar to how human beings do. Though AI algorithms demonstrate fascinating capacities to learn, the use of them does involve harmful consequences. 
            </p>
            
            <p>  

            More specifically, biases in these AI algorithms can result in several issues, including unfair treatment and disparities in patient diagnoses and outcomes. This prominent issue has been gaining more attention in recent years, as technological innovations continue to arise and grow worldwide. To address this issue, this essay aims to explore the harms of algorithmic biases in healthcare and propose potential solutions for alleviating these biases in order to promote fair and equitable treatment for all patients.
